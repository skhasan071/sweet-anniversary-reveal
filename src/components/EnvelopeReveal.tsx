On 19th September 2022, I first saw you, and on the next day we first time have a short talk. The turning point of my life. We collected so many memories from that day until now. Every moment with you is just blessing for me.

Thank you for being there with me always, you helped me so much throughout my college life & now also if you can't do physically you're alway there whenever I need you. I can't express how much you mean to me and that day when you first reply to me. Everything is just dream come true for me. If this is a dream, I wish I never wake up.

I love you, and I love you itna that I can never express in words. You are my sunshine, my bestfriend, my everything. I promise to always be there for you, to support you, and to love you unconditionally.

You are my forever and I really look forward to make this 3 years to 30 years to 300 years & to keep it till eternity.

I love you my baeby. Happy Anniversary! ðŸ’–

Mera gudiya, Meri baeby.
Happy Anniversary! ðŸ’•`;
